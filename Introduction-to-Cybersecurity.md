# 🛡️ TryHackMe: Pre Security Path Walkthrough (ROOMS 1 - 4) 

## 📝 Executive Summary
* **Path Name:** Pre Security
* **Objective:** Learning the absolute prerequisites of cybersecurity, including networking basics, web mechanics, and Linux/Windows fundamentals.

---

## 💻 Module 1: Introduction to Cyber Security

### ⚔️ Room 1: Offensive Security Intro (Completed)

* **Core Concept Learned:** Learned the foundational mindset of an offensive security specialist (ethical hacker), focusing on discovering system vulnerabilities through active exploration.

* **Key Lab Activity:** Tasked with the role of an ethical hacker and navigated a simulated web exploitation scenario to interact with data and see how an attacker targets an asset by using the provided terminal.

* **Flag Found (Answers to the questions asked):**
  - Offensive Security
  - BANK-HACKED
 
* **TOOLS USED**
  - Gobuster: tool used for brute-forcing URIs (directories and files), DNS subdomains, and virtual host names on web servers. It is fast and flexible, often pre-installed on Kali Linux. in the tryhackme room this is the main command that is being used. Because we applied this tool into the terminal we were able to hack into the bank account and succesfully transfer the moeny into the desired account.
  - Linux Terminal: a text-based interface used to control a computer by typing commands.In the tryhackme room this is the terminal we open to apply the gobuster command
  - Firefox Browser: a free web browser made by a group called Mozilla. In the tryhackme room this is the web browser being used to hack into the bank account to transfer the money

* **Room Purpose/ Details** The purpose of this room is teaching hacking by placing us in the role of an ethical hacker. An ethical hacker is someone who is tasked with hacking into a system or program to discover vulnerabilities in their application so stronger security measures can be put into place whether those measures be physical, technical, or adminstrative.

## Security Analysis

This room demonstrated how attackers use reconnaissance and enumeration techniques to gather information about a target before attempting exploitation. Using Gobuster showed how hidden directories and pages that are not properly secured can still be discovered through automated scanning techniques.

This highlights the importance of:

proper access control
removing sensitive hidden directories
monitoring suspicious scanning activity
implementing secure web application configurations

The room also reinforced the idea that ethical hackers use the same tools and techniques as malicious attackers, but with authorization and the goal of improving security defenses.
